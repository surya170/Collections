  =>  Properties class extending properties from Hashtable  class.
  =>  Propeties class is used to avoid hardcoding in the project.
  
  Note : 
    Hardcoding means fixing values in the program
    
    ===============
    Use-Cases 
    ===============
    => If we application wants to communicate with database then we need 
     to use database credentials in java program.
     => IF we hardcode database credentials in java program then 
     maintence will become difficult  why because in future if database credentials 
     modified then we  need to modify our java program also.
     if java program is modified then we need to recompile and re-execute our
     program/project
